			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				A Software Engineer who works by the motto - "Have fun, make an impact, work smart".
				<br /><br />After 4 years of working as a Software Engineer, I started my masters journey at Carnegie Mellon University. I am now a
				proud graduate with a degree in Information Systems Management. <br /><br />I have worked with programming languages like Java,
				Python, and JavaScript using frameworks such as SpringBoot and DJango. My work at Accenture and TCS involved architecting and
				developing web applications as well as backend APIs for large-scale systems. Excited to connect with anyone and everyone who loves
				creating impact with tech. <br /><br />
